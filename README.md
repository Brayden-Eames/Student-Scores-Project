# Student Scores C# Project 

C# Project from my upper division Object-Oriented Windows Design in C#. The program allows the user to input the number of students and
assignments per student. After commiting the counts, the user can then give a name to each student, and assign a specific assignment score 
for each student. Once all the information is entered, clicking 'Display Scores' will calculate each student's average grade and assign each
student a grade letter.
